- **Gravity** with Sandra Bullock and George Clooney: Disappointed. Should have used more 
  time to introduce the characters in their before the disaster. With the 5 minute
  introduction we get here, I never establish a relation to them and the movie suffers.
  Furthermore a lot of music is used. A lot. Even though one of the cool ideas in the
  movie is that space is silent. I imagine the scene with the parachute in complete
  silence (maybe just hearing the breathing) and then seeing the space station getting
  hit in the background -- how scared would we be then? -- how deafening would the silence be?
  The music in the movie just works as replacement for lacking sounds of explosions and
  thus you never get that eerie silence of space which, I think, really could drive
  the viewer's emotions so much further than the shallow characters and manuscript.
  
  This is a thought I have about modern movies in general, I think that thematic
  music has become always present in moves, although it is never present in our own lives.
  This means that the music becomes something that distances us from the movie, and 
  it also accustomes us to the notion of fear. It tells us what to feel.
  But in our own lives; we often don't know what to feel, which can be a great
  driver of fear that should be used in movies as well.
  
  The reality and power of silence has been forgotten.
  
  The main character (Sandra Bullock) makes bad decisions, and thus I have hard time
  relating as I always have.
